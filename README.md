JavaDoc Code Template (autocomplete) for Netbeans

This is a Code template for Javadoc in netbeans.

Netbeans has a code complete function using abbreviation. 
For example typing "sout+Tab" = System.out.println("${cursor}");
There are no default settings for JavaDoc, therefore this feature goes unused in the JavaDoc environment. 
This file provides a basic implementation of these keyboard shortcuts which has been customized for the JavaDoc environment.

The steps to use this file is as follows:
1.	Download as zip file. (It should contain enabledItems.info, build.info and config folder)
2.	In netbeans navigate to Tools> Options> Editor>Code Templates >Import and select the above mentioned zip file.
3. 	Follow the Prompts and allow netbeans to restart.
4.	Navigate to the Code Template section (Step 2) and select JavaDoc from the drop down.
5.	Test the keyboard shortcuts.

Thanks,
